## Review Notes for Apple App Review

```
APP REVIEW NOTES - IN-APP PURCHASE

PURPOSE:
This in-app purchase upgrades a single parking ticket to Premium, unlocking the full suite of features for managing and challenging that specific ticket.

TICKET PREMIUM (£14.99):
Users get everything they need to handle one parking ticket:
- Deadline tracking with email/SMS reminders
- Secure document and evidence storage
- Success prediction based on real UK tribunal decision data
- AI-assisted challenge letters (user reviews and approves before sending)
- Automatic challenge submission — the app goes to the issuer's website and submits the challenge on the user's behalf
- Live portal status checks against issuer websites

HOW IT WORKS:
1. User receives a parking ticket (PCN)
2. User uploads photo of ticket to app (or adds manually)
3. User can upgrade that ticket to Premium for £14.99
4. Alternatively, user can purchase Premium before adding ticket details — a draft ticket is created and the user completes the details later
5. All Premium features unlock immediately
6. Purchase is permanent and non-consumable

WHAT THIS IS NOT:
- Not a guarantee of appeal success
- Not legal advice (user exercises their own legal right to appeal)
- Not a subscription (one-time purchase per ticket)

### Key Phrases to Include:

- Don't claim to provide legal advice
- Don't use misleading pricing language
- Don't promise refunds outside Apple/Google policy
