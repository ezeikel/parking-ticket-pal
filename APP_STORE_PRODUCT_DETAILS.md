## Review Notes for Apple App Review

### For Non-Consumables (One-Time Ticket Upgrades)

```
APP REVIEW NOTES - ONE-TIME TICKET UPGRADES

PURPOSE:
These in-app purchases upgrade a single parking ticket to unlock premium features for managing and appealing that specific ticket.

TICKET STANDARD (£2.99):
Users get email/SMS reminders, timeline tracking, and document storage for one parking ticket.

TICKET PREMIUM (£9.99):
Users get everything in Standard plus:
- AI-generated appeal letters based on UK parking law
- Success prediction analysis
- Automatic challenge submission to parking authorities

HOW IT WORKS:
1. User receives a parking ticket (PCN)
2. User uploads photo of ticket to app
3. User can purchase Standard or Premium upgrade for that specific ticket
4. Upgraded features unlock immediately for that ticket
5. Purchase is permanent and non-consumable

WHAT THIS IS NOT:
- Not a guarantee of appeal success
- Not legal advice (user exercises their own legal right to appeal)
- Not a subscription (one-time purchase per ticket)

### For Subscriptions

```
APP REVIEW NOTES - SUBSCRIPTIONS

- Fair use policy applies

HOW IT WORKS:
1. User subscribes via in-app purchase
2. User can create and manage tickets up to their plan limit each month
