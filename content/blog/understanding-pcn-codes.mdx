## What is a Contravention Code?

Every Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) comes with a contravention code. This two or three-digit number is the issuing authority's way of telling you the specific rule they believe you broke. Understanding this code is the first step in deciding whether to pay or appeal.

### Common Parking Contravention Codes

While there are hundreds of codes, some are far more common than others. Here are a few you're likely to encounter:

-   **Code 01: Parked in a restricted street during prescribed hours.** This is a classic. It means you parked on a single yellow line (or similar) at a time when parking was not allowed. Your appeal would need to focus on unclear signage or a genuine emergency.
-   **Code 12: Parked in a residents' or shared use parking place without clearly displaying either a permit or voucher or pay and display ticket issued for that place.** This often happens in controlled parking zones (CPZs). If your permit fell off the dashboard, an appeal with photographic evidence might be successful.
-   **Code 24: Not parked correctly within the markings of the bay or space.** This is for when your wheels are over the line. It can be worth appealing if the bay was unusually small or another vehicle forced you to park awkwardly.

### Moving Traffic Contraventions

It's not just about parking. Moving traffic offences are also common:

-   **Code 33: Using a route restricted to certain vehicles.** This is the classic "bus lane" ticket. Check the times of operation carefully; they are often not 24/7.
-   **Code 50: Performing a prohibited turn.** Usually a "No Left Turn" or "No U-Turn". Signage is key hereâ€”if it's not clearly visible, you have grounds for appeal.

### How to Use This Information

When you receive a PCN, don't just look at the fine. Find the contravention code and look it up. Does it accurately describe the situation? Was the signage clear? Were there mitigating circumstances? Answering these questions will form the foundation of your appeal.

```jsx
function checkContravention(code) {
  if (code === '01') {
    return "Check the street signs for time restrictions.";
  }
  if (code === '12') {
    return "Ensure your permit is clearly displayed.";
  }
  if (code === '24') {
    return "Verify that your wheels are within the bay markings.";
  }
  if (code === '33') {
    return "Confirm the times of operation for restricted routes.";
  }
  if (code === '50') {
    return "Check if the signage for prohibited turns was clearly visible.";
  }
  return "Consult the local council's website for details.";
}
```

Knowledge is power when it comes to fighting parking tickets.
